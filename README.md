# La Tajada's MMA Stuff

This repository holds a collection of MMA ([Musical Midi Accompaniment](https://www.mellowood.ca/mma/)) grooves, songs, and patterns used by the author for his own practice purposes. They are shared here in the hopes that other may find them usefull.

## Installation

Except for the _songs_ folder (that can go wherever you want), the folders in here are meant to follow the same structure as the default distribution of mma. The folders in _lib_ (grooves) can go in mma's _lib_ folder and the folders in _includes_ (patterns) can go in mma's _include_ folder.

Usage and more detailed descriptions of the grooves, songs, and patterns are in each folder.
